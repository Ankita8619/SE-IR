# Automated Document Similarity Analysis  

This project implements a lightweight search engine to compute and rank document similarity using **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**. It processes 132 documents to identify and rank the most similar pairs, supporting applications like plagiarism detection and document clustering.  

## Features  
- **Custom Tokenization**: Processes text without third-party libraries.  
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Calculates term weights for precise comparisons.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures and ranks similarity between documents.  
- **Max-Heap Storage**: Efficiently retrieves the top 50 document pairs.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SE-IR.git  
   cd document-similarity-ranking
   ```
